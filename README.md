# IST256-Final-Coding-Project
During my Spring 2022 semester at Syracuse University, I took a Python class where we had to create a final project at the end. I decided to make my project a usuable and interactive Pokémon Pokedex consisting of the first 151 Pokémon. I coded this project on Jupyter Notebook/Hub. The project includes methods like an API, Dictionaries, Pandas, MatPlots, etc.
